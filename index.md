# Welcome

The ARK Portal hosts data generated by a network of research teams working 
collaboratively to deepen the understanding of Arthritis and Autoimmune and 
Related Diseases. It was established by the National Institute of Arthritis 
and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) and includes data from the Accelerating 
Medicines Partnership® (AMP®).

## ARK Portal data standards

Data standards are a set of rules that define how data is recorded, 
described, and shared. They help ensure that data is consistent, accurate, 
and comply with FAIR data practices.
