The synID of the corresponding Synapse entity that stores metadata about the publication. This is used to differentiate publication-specific files, often consisting of level 4 processed data and expanded subject metadata, in a publication dataset that also includes raw or minimally processed files from experimental datasets. This provides an easy way to distinguish and select for the publication-specific data from which the research findings were derived. When this attribute is used to annotate a Dataset it serves as a way to directly link the Dataset entity with the publication metadata stored in Synapse.
