# plateID
An identifier assigned to a multi-well plate. Certain data types and assays profile samples using multi-well plates. Knowing which samples were profiled on each plate is important for establishing sample provenance, finding the right data files for a specific set of samples, as well as downstream exploratory data analysis and QC work particularly regarding identification and correction of batch effects.
