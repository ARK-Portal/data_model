# altSampleID
An alternate identifier for a sample. With some assays there can be default or alternate sample identifiers entered into the data collection software. If you will be uploading data collected with an alternate identifier please provide that here. In some cases, the ARK BDM team will use this field to capture original but out-dated identifiers for samples.
