# sequencingSaturation
A measure of the fraction of library complexity that was sequenced in a library. This metric quantifies the fraction of reads originating from an already-observed UMI. More specifically, this is the fraction of confidently mapped, valid cell-barcode, valid UMI reads that are non-unique. Scale is 0-1.
