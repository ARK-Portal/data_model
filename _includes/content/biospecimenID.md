# biospecimenID
A unique identifier assigned to specimens collected from study participants. For multi-specimen data files provide all IDs in a comma-separated list.

Given the variety of projects hosting data in the ARK Portal, there are no syntax or formatting rules in place at this time.  Best practices would entail standardization of `biospecimenID` strings within the scope of a project or larger collaborative effort to ensure consistency and enforce uniqueness.
