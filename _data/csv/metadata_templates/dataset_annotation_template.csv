"acknowledgmentStatement","A Dataset-specific attribute specifying the path to the wiki subpage within the ARK Portal - backend project that contains the acknowledgement statement that must be included in publications using data from the given dataset as a stipulation of the conditions of use.","True","syn26710600/wiki/619685"
"biospecimenSubtype","Biospecimen status before sample is processed into a scRNA-seq library. Several scRNA-seq technologies support a variety of sample processing methods which can introduces sources of technical variation.","False","FFPE tissue, PFA-fixed tissue, cell or tissue lysate, cell suspension, flow-sorted cells, fresh tissue, frozen tissue, nuclei suspension, supernatant"
"dbGapAccession","NIH policy requires large-scale human genomics studies to be registered in dbGap. This is a Dataset-specific attribute indicating the unique identifier (i.e., accession) of the corresponding study that is registered in dbGap, formatted as a compact URI, e.g., dbgap:phs003417.v2.p1","False",""

"associatedCodeURL","A URL to the repository where associated code is available.","False",""
"dataType","High-level classification of the type of data contained in the file, loosely related to the experimental method or biological entity that is being profiled. Select all that apply using a comma-delimited list, though in most cases only a single label is expected. For multimodal datasets with concomitant profiling of biospecimen include 'multimodal'.","True","cytometry, epigenomics, genomics, histology, immune repertoire profiling, immunostaining, lipidomics, metabolomics, microbiome, multimodal, proteomics, transcriptomics"
"publicationSynID","The synID of the corresponding Synapse entity that stores metadata about the publication. This is used to differentiate publication-specific files, often consisting of level 4 processed data and expanded subject metadata, in a publication dataset that also includes raw or minimally processed files from experimental datasets. This provides an easy way to distinguish and select for the publication-specific data from which the research findings were derived. When this attribute is used to annotate a Dataset it serves as a way to directly link the Dataset entity with the publication metadata stored in Synapse.","False",""

"program","Name of the funding program that supported the generation of data and associated files","True","AMP AIM, AMP RA/SLE, Community Contribution"
"associatedDataset","The synID of a Dataset entity. This serves to link other Synapse entities to Dataset entities. When used to annotate a publication Dataset this attribute should include the synID for an experimental Datasets from which the publication data was derived. Multiple synID can be specified using a comma-delimited list.","False",""
"ARKRelease","A Dataset-specific attribute specifying the ARK Portal release in which this dataset was first made available to the public.","True","1.0, 2.0, 2024.06.R1, 2024.07.R1, 2024.08.R1, 2024.09.R1, 2024.10.R1, 2024.12.R1, 2025.01.R1, 2025.02.R1, 2025.03.R1, 2025.04.R1, 2025.05.R1, 2025.06.R1, 2025.07.R1, 2025.08.R1, 2025.09.R1, 2025.10.R1, 2025.11.R1, 2025.12.R1"
