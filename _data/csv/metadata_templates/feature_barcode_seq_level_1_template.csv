"nucleicAcidSource","The source of the nucleic acid used as input for sequencing library fragments. Select all that apply, though in most cases only a single label is expected.",TRUE,"poly(A) RNA, rRNA-depleted RNA, gDNA, surface protein feature barcode, intracellular protein feature barcode, antigen capture barcode, multiplexing oligo, BCR mRNA, TCR mRNA, Tn5-accessible gDNA, globin-depleted RNA, CRISPR protospacer feature barcode"

"libraryID","",FALSE,""
"batch","A label or identifier that is unique within a given experiment or dataset used to group data related to sample processing, sample pooling, or data collection batches. These batches often introduce technical effects that can be important to account for in downstream analyses.",FALSE,""
"publicationSynID","The synID of the corresponding Synapse entity that stores metadata about the publication. This is used to differentiate publication-specific files, often consisting of level 4 processed data and expanded subject metadata, in a publication dataset that also includes raw or minimally processed files from experimental datasets. This provides an easy way to distinguish and select for the publication-specific data from which the research findings were derived. When this attribute is used to annotate a Dataset it serves as a way to directly link the Dataset entity with the publication metadata stored in Synapse.",FALSE,""
